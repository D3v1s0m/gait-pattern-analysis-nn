A deep learning project for analyzing and classifying gait patterns using neural networks.

## Overview

Gait analysis plays a crucial role in various fields, including healthcare and biomechanics. This repository contains a deep learning solution for gait pattern analysis using neural networks. By leveraging the power of deep learning, we aim to automatically classify different gait patterns, including those associated with medical conditions such as Cerebellar Ataxia, Hereditary Spastic Paraparesis, Parkinson's Disease, and data from Healthy Controls.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature extraction for gait data.
- Neural network architecture designed for gait pattern classification.
- Training and evaluation scripts.
- Model checkpoints for easy reusability.
- Visualization tools for analyzing model performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10.6
- TensorFlow 2.13.0
- Other dependencies (specified in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/D3v1s0m/gait-pattern-analysis-nn.git
